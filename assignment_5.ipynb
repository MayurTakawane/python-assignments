    "\n",
    "2.what is the value of dictionary value with key 'foo' and the value 42 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: {'foo':42}\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Dictionaries are represented by {} where as listed are represented by []\n",

    "4.What happens if you try to access spam ['foo'] if spam is {'bar':100} ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: we will get a keyError KeyError: 'foo'\n",
    "\n",
    "5.if a dictionary is stored in spam,what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys() ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: There is no difference . The operator checks whether a value exits as a key in the dictionary or not\n",
    "\n",
    "6.if a dictionary is stored in spam,what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values() ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:'cat' in spam checks whether there is a 'cat' key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam.values() checks whether there is a value 'cat' for one of the keys in spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.what is a shortcut for the following code ?\n",
    "if 'color' not in spam: spam['color'] ='black'\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "8.How do you 'pretty print' dictionary values using which modules and function ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: we can pretty print a dictionary using three functions\n",
    "\n",
    "by using pprint() function of pprint module\n",
    "Note: pprint() function doesnot prettify nested dictionaries\n",
    "by using dumps() method of json module\n",
